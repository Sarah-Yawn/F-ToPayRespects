!!Note!!
This table is set to auto-increment the userId.
This is only meant to happen for customers.
As long as customers aren't given the option to choose their id
but employees and admins do pick their id this should work properly.
Id's are just integers.

Also, accountType is E for employee, A for admin, and C for customer.
